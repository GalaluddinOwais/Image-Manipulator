# About the project
#### This project aims to apply a wide range of image processing techniques to an uploaded image, offering the user the freedom to select, apply, undo, or redo these techniques, and to save the modified image, effectively serving as an image editor

# Key Achievements

* Implemented various image processing techniques:
  * Thresholding
  * Gray-level Quantization (Bit-Depth Reduction)
  * Sharpening
  * Smoothing (Gaussian Smoothing)
  * Preserving-Edges Smoothing (Median Smoothing)
  * Image Inversion
  * Edge Detection (Vertical - Horizontal - Both)
  * Contrast Stretching
  * Logarithmic Transformation (Darkness Stretching)
  * Power Transformation (Lightness Stretching)
  * Noise Removal (Mean Filtering)
  * Histogram Adjustment
  * Erosion (Min Filtering)
  * Dilation (Max Filtering)
  * Image Adding
  * Image subtraction
  * Downsampling
  * Upsampling
  * Gray Scale Conversion
  * Showing Histogram
  * Showing Bit Plane Slices
  * Color Inspection



* Designed an intuitive user interface to get the image uploaded, specifically analyzed and manipulated, and finally saved
